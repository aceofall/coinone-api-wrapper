# Brief
The very minimal wrapper for Coinone API.

# Examples
Read `example*.py` for its usage.
In order to execute examples, you have to make a file named `secret.py` which 
only contains following two line.

    ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your acess token'
    SECRET_KEY = 'your secret key'

# Dependancies

* python(>=3.5)
* numpy

# Note
USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! THESE SCRIPTS CAN DESTROY YOUR BALANCE!
